/*5. Write a program that takes a 9-digit integer as input, computes the checksum
digit d₁₀ and prints the complete 10-digit ISBN number. If the checksum digit d₁₀
is 10, simply print the letter 'X'. You must use a loop (of your choice) to calculate
the sum. Hint: The formula for computing the 10th digit is sum % 11.
